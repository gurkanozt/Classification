# Classification 
#Intro
This is a Python 2.7 and Gurobi implementation of some Feature Selection and Classification algorithms.  
Implemented algorithms and related papers:  
    * Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseperable Sets, Bennet and Mangasarian, 1992  
    * Seperation via polyhedral conic functions, Gasimov and Ozturk, 2006
#Usage
examples.py file includes examples for each algorithm. Necessary datasets also included.
To work on these algorithms Gurobi solver, gurobi.py and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ "sckitlearn") are required. Gurobi licence is free for students and academic researchers.
